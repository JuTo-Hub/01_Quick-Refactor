# Code-Refractory-Project

The goal of this project was to clean up the code while keeping the same style on the page. 

*__To improve the code of the html page:__*
* Added a reset.css file to ensure the page doesn't rely on any browser specific styling.
* Removed div tags for more appropriate tags such as header, section and footer.
* Removed unnecessary class tags and grouped similar elements under one class.
* Added alt tags to img tags for accessibility.
* Gave the page a proper title.
* Fixed broken link. 


*__To improve the css file:__*

* Removed unnecessary selectors.
* Consolidated classes with similar properties.
* Reorder selectors to match their place in the html file
* Removed background img from css and added it to the html file.
